üß¨ DNA Sequence Analysis
This repository contains a Python script for analyzing DNA sequences from FASTA files. The script identifies Open Reading Frames (ORFs) across reading frames and performs various sequence analyses, including repeat detection.

üöÄ Features
ORF Identification: Detects the longest Open Reading Frames in specified reading frames.

Sequence Statistics: Calculates the longest and shortest sequence lengths.

Repeat Counting: Identifies the most frequent k-mers of specified lengths (e.g., 6, 7, 12).

üõ†Ô∏è Installation
1. Clone the repository
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/Anwesha19-prog/dna-sequence-analysis.git
cd dna-sequence-analysis
2. Install dependencies
Make sure Python is installed, then install Biopython:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install biopython
‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage
Prepare your FASTA file
Place your FASTA file in the directory or update the script with its path.

Run the script

Edit the script to include your FASTA file path:

python
Copy
Edit
fasta_file = r"your_fasta_file.fasta"  # replace with your file path
results = analyze_fasta(fasta_file)
Then run the script:

bash
Copy
Edit
python analyze_fasta.py
View Results
The script will output various sequence statistics. For example:

python
Copy
Edit
print(f"Number of records: {results['record_count']}")
print(f"Length of the longest sequence: {results['longest_seq_len']}")
print(f"Length of the shortest sequence: {results['shortest_seq_len']}")
print(f"Length of the longest ORF in reading frame 2: {results['longest_orf_rf2']}")
print(f"Starting position of the longest ORF in reading frame 3: {results['longest_orf_rf3_start']}")
print(f"Length of the longest ORF in reading frame 3: {results['longest_orf_rf3_len']}")
print(f"Length of the longest ORF in any forward reading frame: {results['longest_orf_any_frame']}")
